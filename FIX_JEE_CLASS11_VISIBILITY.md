# Fix Applied: JEE Class 11 Cards Now Visible in Kanban Board

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The JEE Class 11 study plan cards were not showing up in the Kanban board due to a **data type mismatch** in the filtering logic.

### Root Cause

- **Data Format**: The study plans data stored `grade` as a **string** (`"11"`)
- **Filter Logic**: The application was comparing using `parseInt(selectedClass)` which creates an **integer** comparison
- **Result**: String `"11"` !== Integer `11` → No matches found

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Grade Filtering (2 locations)

**Location 1: `useEffect` hook for grade/curriculum changes (line ~2523)**
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
plan.grade === parseInt(selectedClass)

// AFTER (fixed)
String(plan.grade) === String(selectedClass)
```

**Location 2: `fetchData` function initial filtering (line ~2848)**
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
plan.grade === parseInt(selectedClass)

// AFTER (fixed)
String(plan.grade) === String(selectedClass)
```

### 2. Created Database Export

Created `export-study-plans-to-json.js` script that:
- Reads from `public/study-plans-data.js`
- Exports to `public/database-export.json` (required by the app)
- Includes all 47 JEE Class 11 records

## 📊 Verification

### Data Structure Confirmed
```json
{
  "studyPlans": [
    {
      "unique_id": "JEE-11-PHY-1.1",
      "curriculum": "JEE",
      "grade": "11",  // ✅ String format
      "subject": "Physics",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "totalRecords": 47
}
```

### Filter Logic Now Handles Both Types
The new comparison `String(plan.grade) === String(selectedClass)` works for:
- ✅ String grades: `"11"` === `"11"` → true
- ✅ Number grades: `String(11)` === `String(11)` → true
- ✅ Mixed data: Converts both to string before comparing

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

When you reload the application:

1. **Select Grade 11** from the class filter
2. **Select JEE** from the curriculum filter  
3. **See all subjects**: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics
4. **View chapters** in the Kanban board organized by status:
   - **In Queue**: 13 topics
   - **To Do**: 13 topics
   - **In Progress**: 13 topics
   - **Done**: 8 topics

## 📁 Files Modified

1. ✅ `pages/index.js` - Fixed grade comparison in 2 locations
2. ✅ `public/database-export.json` - Created from study-plans-data.js
3. ✅ `export-study-plans-to-json.js` - New export utility script

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Reload your browser** to clear cache
2. **Verify filters** are set to:
   - Class: **11**
   - Curriculum: **JEE**
3. **Select a subject** (Physics, Chemistry, or Mathematics)
4. **You should now see** all the chapters in the Kanban board!
