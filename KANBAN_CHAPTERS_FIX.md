# 🎯 All Chapters Now Visible in Kanban Board

## Problem Solved ✅

Your Kanban board was only showing **1 chapter per subject** (3 total) because the fallback demo data had limited records. Now all **53 chapters** with **235 study plan topics** are loaded from your SQLite database!

## What Changed

### 1. **Database Export Utility** (`export-db-to-json.js`)
- Automatically exports all data from SQLite database to JSON
- Runs before every build as a `prebuild` script
- Generates: `/public/database-export.json` (242 KB)
- Also saves to: `/public/study-plans-data.js` (Node.js format)

### 2. **Smart Data Loading** (Updated `fetchData()`)
The app now follows this priority:
1. ✅ **Database Export** (`/public/database-export.json`) - LIVE DATA
2. 📱 **localStorage** - User edits/additions
3. 📦 **Fallback Demo Data** - If JSON unavailable

### 3. **Build Process**
```bash
npm run build
# Automatically:
# 1. Exports database to JSON
# 2. Next.js builds the app
# 3. All 235 records are available at runtime
```

### 4. **Debug Panel**
In the Kanban view, you'll see:
- Total chapters count
- Total topics count  
- Status distribution by bucket
- List of all chapters with their status

## Usage

### Export Database Manually
```bash
npm run export:db
```

### Export Before Build (Automatic)
```bash
npm run build
# Automatically exports database first
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Loads data from localStorage or fallback
```

## 📊 Current Data

```
✅ Total Records: 235
📚 Unique Chapters: 53
📖 Subjects: Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics
```

### Chapter Breakdown
- **Physics**: ~17 chapters
- **Chemistry**: ~18 chapters  
- **Mathematics**: ~18 chapters

## 🎨 Features Now Available

### On Kanban Board
- ✅ All 53 chapters visible across 4 buckets (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop between buckets updates status
- ✅ Click any chapter to see all topics in a popup
- ✅ Edit topics, update progress, add notes
- ✅ All changes persist in localStorage

### Search & Filter
- Filter by subject
- Sort by status
- Group by chapter
- Progress indicators

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages
The exported JSON is included in the `public/` folder and will be deployed with your app:

```
public/
├── database-export.json      ← Auto-generated
├── study-plans-data.js       ← Auto-generated  
└── ...other files
```

### Next Build
All changes automatically re-export the database:
```bash
npm run build
# → Exports 235 records from database
# → Builds Next.js app
# → Deploys with all data to GitHub Pages
```

## 🔧 Customization

### To add more chapters
Edit your Prisma model or import via CSV, then:
```bash
npm run seed           # Seed from CSV
npm run export:db     # Export to JSON
npm run build         # Build and deploy
```

### To modify export
Edit `export-db-to-json.js` and adjust:
- Fields included in export
- Grouping logic
- Output locations

## 📝 Files Changed

- ✅ `export-db-to-json.js` - NEW export utility
- ✅ `pages/index.js` - Updated fetchData() function
- ✅ `package.json` - Added export scripts
- ✅ `public/database-export.json` - AUTO-GENERATED
- ✅ `public/study-plans-data.js` - AUTO-GENERATED

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test Kanban Board** - Switch between subjects, see all chapters
2. **Check Debug Panel** - Verify chapter counts match
3. **Try Drag-and-Drop** - Move chapters between buckets
4. **Add More Data** - Seed more chapters from CSV

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Missing chapters?
- Run: `npm run export:db` to re-export
- Check browser console for load confirmation
- Verify database has data: Check SQLite file

### Deployment not showing data?
- Ensure `database-export.json` is in `/public`
- Re-run build: `npm run build`
- Check GitHub Pages deployment includes `/public`

### Performance slow?
- 242 KB JSON is compressed in GitHub Pages
- Data loads once on app start
- All filtering happens client-side (fast)
