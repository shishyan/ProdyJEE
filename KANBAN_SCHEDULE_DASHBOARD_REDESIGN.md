## üìÅ Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `pages/index.js` - Kanban board with Group By and horizontal Backlog
2. ‚úÖ `pages/schedule.js` - Added view switcher and Add Event button
3. ‚è≥ `pages/dashboard.js` - Needs complete reimagination

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority

1. **Complete Schedule Views**
   ```javascript
   // Add to schedule.js
   const renderDailyView = () => { /* 24-hour timeline */ }
   const renderWeeklyView = () => { /* 7-day grid with time slots */ }
   const renderMonthlyView = () => { /* Existing huge calendar */ }
   
   // Add event functions
   const saveEvent = (event) => { /* Save to localStorage */ }
   const deleteEvent = (eventId) => { /* Remove from localStorage */ }
   ```

2. **Implement Add Event Modal**
   ```javascript
   {showAddEvent && (
     <div>/* Modal with form fields */</div>
   )}
   ```

3. **Redesign Dashboard**
   - Create new layout structure
   - Fetch study plan progress data
   - Calculate metrics (completion %, averages, streaks)
   - Implement JEE countdown timer
   - Add charts (using existing chart components or simple CSS)

## üí° Design Principles Applied

- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effect with blur
- **Neumorphism**: Soft shadows on buttons
- **Microinteractions**: Hover animations, scale transforms
- **Nature backgrounds**: Images instead of gradients
- **Color psychology**: 
  - Green for success/add actions
  - Purple for primary actions
  - Red for weak areas/urgent
  - Blue for information/calm

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time Remaining

- Schedule Daily View: 30 minutes
- Schedule Weekly View: 45 minutes
- Add Event Modal: 30 minutes
- Dashboard Complete Redesign: 2-3 hours
- Testing & Refinements: 1 hour

**Total: ~5 hours of development**
